[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) is a popular Java-based game that has millions of active users around the world. 
This project aims to port it to Rust as a purely for fun endeavour! To speak on the technicals,
this project will be using minimal graphical dependencies and a custom game engine. It will utilize 
an [Entity-Component System (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) to manage
game objects and gameplay.
